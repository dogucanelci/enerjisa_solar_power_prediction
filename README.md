# enerjisa_solar_power_prediction

This project can be defined as a project to create a machine learning regression model that predicts the energy produced by solar way, which is a renewable energy type. 
The models to be created for this problem are designed to best predict the power values that a solar panel is expected to produce. 
By comparing these estimation results with their production, unexpected performance deficiencies of the panel can be detected and resolved.
